# phl.ink

Phlink is a URL shortener implemented with Elixir and the Phoenix framework.

It's purpose is to be a simple problem domain I can use when learning how to
develop, deploy, and maintain Phoenix and Elixir applications.

It's currently deployed to Heroku at [http://phl.ink](http://phlink).

## Running

To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
